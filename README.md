Hark-Upon-The-Gale
==================

This branch will try to get the collisions code up to snuff - getting the player to stay on-screen, destroying bullets as they leave, etc.  Right now, it... works, sort of, so I might just push this to the master branch tomorrow.  I'm not sure.

-The current working directory is UnityProject/ShooterTest
